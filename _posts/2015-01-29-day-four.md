title:  "Day four - Ah-ha!"
---

After a bit of lecture, Sumeet called me and a couple others upstairs to go over a lot of items we were unclear on.

Wow, it was awesome! Despite a quick yoga break, he went over just how everything works together: Objects, classes, methods, variables, attributes, etc. Not the whole enchilada, but definitely enough to fill in the gaps in my understanding. He challenged us to forget about the recent Rock, Paper, Scissors project and to start back at Day 1 with the Checksplitter project, adding on DinnerClub and getting those to work well.

When I finally sat down at home last night before bed to start on it, I was able to quickly write out my requirements and then completed the Checksplitter homework within about 10 minutes, with some comments!

You can see the difference a little knowledge makes by comparing my first code:

To my new code:

It was so easy (granted, I had a really good understanding of the assignment by the time I redid it).
