title:  "Second day - Ugh!"
---

After learning about Objects and Classes for the first time yesterday, I thought I had a fundamental grasp of them. I struggled through a Checksplitter class creation homework assignment (it was not pretty, but it worked!) and came to class today where we reviewed the work of another student. They had a totally different approach (looked more logical and correct than mine!) and going through their code seemed to make sense as we cleaned up methods and more.

Then, Sumeet dropped our next in-class project on us: to add a new Dinner Club class to our Checksplitter program that I thought I understood the concept of what I should do, but just cannot figure out how to do it. 

My biggest problem is modeling out what I need to do, what I need to use in order to make it work. Heck, just building a class is still so new and really tough when I am now worrying over all these new parameters I need to add, and add it to my sub-par Checksplitter program to make it work with that! Ugh.

Pretty discouraged, but will try and find time to hit Treehouse and brush up on my understanding of Objects and Classes.

I understand there will be a lot of moments like these, but I definitely need a better understanding of all of this before I can truly get some "wins" under my belt.
