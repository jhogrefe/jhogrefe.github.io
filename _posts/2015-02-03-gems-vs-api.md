title:  "Difference between a Ruby Gem and an API"
---

Today we got an overview of Ruby Gems and APIs, along with an assignment that challenges us to install some gems to use in new ruby files, and to sign up for a Marvel API and create a small program that gets character information from Marvel using the API.

So, what exactly are Ruby Gems and APIs?

**Ruby Gem**

A ruby gem is essentially a library or plug-in created by someone else that gives you specific functionality for a Ruby program you are creating. You can install gems for free, and then it's as simple as referencing the gem's "relative" file at the top of your file and calling whatever methods the gem includes.

**API**

An API is a bit like a gem in that it has been created by someone else and gives you functionality for a Ruby program you are creating. The difference is you generally need to sign up for an API in order to receive API keys that you initialize when running your Ruby file. You can use an API free in most cases up to a certain limit of calls (generally per day), or pay for more calls.
