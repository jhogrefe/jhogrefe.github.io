title:  "Working remotely..."
---

Today was a snow day. Years ago it would have been awesome to have a day off, but this time it kinda sucked. There were a couple good things:

**When you have to focus on doing a code review for yourself and several others it helps you step back and see your code in a different light.** Evaluating what I was weak on and having others focus their attention on helping in those areas really helped reconnect me to CADEJO! It's easy to get lost in your own work and feel like you don't want to be a burden to others so you pull back from asking for help, but everyone really stepped up and made me feel like I wasn't in this alone. I truly appreciate that!

**It was great to learn some tricks to working remotely!** Collaborating via Slack, Github and Dropbox, while polishing video presentation skills in QuickTime was pretty cool. I like how OCS doesn't pigeonhole us into only utilizing 1 or 2 online tools for discussing work with instructors and students. 

I wish I could say working remotely was 100% terrific, but unfortunately my snow day also meant a snow day for my kids, so there were regular distractions I had to manage working at home. Being at OCS definitely helps my focus, and also helps remind you that there are others working with you (or, just around you!). That is one of the pitfalls of only working remotely: you eventually feel a bit disconnected to others you work with and a spirit of teamwork starts to fade. That being said, finding a nice balance of remote work and working in an office with others would definitely be nice!
