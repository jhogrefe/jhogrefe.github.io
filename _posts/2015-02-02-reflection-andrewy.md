title:  "Reflection for Andrew Yolland"
---

Looking through Andrew's code for Rock, Paper, Scissors was really enjoyable! Although I am an entire assignment behind his code was very easy to read and digest for a number of reasons:

**1) Excellent naming conventions**
Every method, class, and variable was named by what it did. Since Andrew followed Single Responsibility Principle throughout most of his code this made it easy to name everything by what they do since they each only do one thing!

**2) Short, concise methods and classes**
Andrew added an extra class for Rules which helped break out more code so the other classes did not have as much work to do. 

**3) Great documentation**
Everything in his rps code was well documented and explained exactly what it does. He appeared to have no problem communicating how a well-seasoned programmer would (something I am still working on!).

Although nearly everything looked great, it was interesting to see even Andrew had some question on how to break down a couple methods more, as they were doing a lot of work. I know most people in the class are struggling with this to some degree which brings up the question: it is ever ok to have a couple methods be workhorses, or do you really need to figure out how to knock them all down on size? Definitely a question to ask Sumeet or Andrew this week!
