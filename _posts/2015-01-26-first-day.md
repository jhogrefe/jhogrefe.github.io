title:  "First day at OCS!"

Moving through the prep work that past month was a bit overwhelming at times, so it was a welcome relief to find out how many other people felt the same way. I learned a bunch and will hopefully remember some of it tomorrow!

One thing we learned today was how to use the Command line in Terminal to work with git.

git init #initialize git on a directory
git add #add changes you make to a git stage
git commit #commit everything in stage to the newest version
git status #great way to see git status, and if you have any unmodified files

***

A second thing I learned during the Ruby review was how to loop through a hash. For example:

hash = {"one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3}

hash.each do |x,y|
  puts "The key is #{x} and the value is #{y}."
end
